          <h2>Hailemichael Molla</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Hailemichael Molla, and I was born on February 15, 2004, in the vibrant
            city of Bahirdar, Ethiopia. Located on the shores of Lake Tana, the largest lake in Ethiopia,
              Bahirdar is known for its stunning natural beauty, including the iconic Blue Nile Falls. Growing
              up in this serene environment greatly influenced my curiosity, creativity, and appreciation for innovation.
              I am the second child in my family and have the privilege of growing up with two amazing brothers. From an early age,
                I was a dedicated student with a strong passion for technology. My family has always been my greatest source of inspiration, 
                providing unwavering support and encouragement that have shaped who I am today.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My educational journey began at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School in Bahirdar, where I studied from KG1 through Grade 12. This school not
           only provided me with a strong academic foundation but also fostered my curiosity and problem-solving skills. While at SOS HGS, I was
            actively involved in various clubs and extracurricular activities, which helped me explore my passion for technology and leadership. 
            I credit much of my early growth to the supportive environment and inspiring mentors I had during this time.After graduating high school,
             I pursued higher education at Addis Ababa University, one of the top universities in Ethiopia. I am now a third-year software engineering student,
              focusing on acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to address real-world challenges through technology.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <P>In my free time, I enjoy staying active by playing football and spending quality time with my friends and family. I find joy in participating in voluntary
             activities, as giving back to my community is something I deeply value. Relaxing with a good movie or watching football matches is another way I unwind.
              I also love playing video games and exploring new ideas and perspectives through reading books, which helps me grow both personally and intellectually.</P>
