        <h2>Achievments</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have had the opportunity to participate in various activities that have contributed 
          to my growth both personally and professionally. I completed my education from KG1 to Grade 12 at SOS 
          Hermann Gmeiner School in Bahirdar, where I developed a strong foundation for my academic journey. Currently,
          I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University, where I am honing my skills to contribute
          to the tech community.During my school years, I actively participated in extracurricular activities and received certificates
          for being involved in the ICT Club, Scout Club, and Charity Club, where I was able to develop leadership, collaboration, 
          and community-oriented skills. I also demonstrated my passion for technology early on by attempting to build a school management
          system for my school, which showcased my interest in using technology to streamline processes and solve problems.In addition
          to my academic and technological pursuits, I have always been passionate about sports. I was part of the Pre-Engineering football
          team at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAiT), where we won the football competition and I received a medal for our victory,
          reflecting teamwork, dedication, and sportsmanship.I am also deeply committed to giving back to the community. In 2024, I had 
          the privilege of volunteering at the Ethiopian Great Run, which was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to contribute to a national event and support the growth of such initiatives in my country.
